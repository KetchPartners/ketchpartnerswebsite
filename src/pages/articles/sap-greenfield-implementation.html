### CHALLENGE

Our hi-tech industry client had been running a highly customized SAP ECC for over 17 years and during that time developed an aggressive acquisition strategy averaging 5 companies per year.  The acquisitions were primarily in the IT services space so ultimately the client was acquiring many new and different business models supported by various legacy ERP systems without the ability to integrate the acquired companies into their existing SAP ECC system. This situation was further complicated by the fact that they could not risk disruption to their core business (and supporting ERP processes).

### INSIGHT

Our client recognized that they were operating in a constantly changing marketplace. They knew they needed a completely new platform with un-constrained business processes to achieve their vision for the company or they risked being unable to adapt to opportunities in the marketplace.  

### SOLUTION

The company engaged Ketch to implement a greenfield SAP S/4HANA solution with the mandate to focus on best practice processes and minimal enhancements to allow the design and delivery of a flexible, scalable platform that is capable of absorbing many different business models as they grow.  Leveraging SAP Central Finance solution, we were able to choose the speed at which core business (customers and contracts) were migrated from ECC to S/4HANA; significantly reducing risk and spreading the cost of the project over several fiscal years, enabling justification of the capital expenditure. Ketch worked with our client to develop a 4-year roadmap for migrating their entire business to the new platform.  The major deployments were as follows:

1. S/4HANA for master data governance of customers, materials and vendors synchronized with the ECC system and  CPQ (Configurable pricing and quoting) for legacy contracts in ECC.
2. S/4HANA, SAP Central Finance, CPQ (Configurable pricing and quoting) and a 3rd-party field service solution with all inventory and fulfillment remaining in the ECC system until a more appropriate/suitable time.
3. S/4HANA for the entire business; migrating all customer and contracts to new offerings.  Moving all warehousing and logistics functions from ECC to S/4HANA EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) for all inventory management and fulfillment. (Central Finance would remain to allow quick integration of future acquisitions into S/4HANA Simple Finance.)

Once the roadmap was defined, we collaboratively scoped and planned each phase, deploying the resources required to support each phase. During the first phase, we leveraged Ketch’s Best Practice Alignment to deploy a live S/4HANA system designed to show a flexible business model platform that could scale to any support any acquisition scenario and determine gaps.  This approach allowed client subject matter experts to visualize a system un-constrained by 17 years of custom enhancements and truly think creatively about the best design for the new system.
We then designed the new enterprise structure for finance, sales and logistics and utilized Central Finance (along with Central Payments), coupled with enhanced mapping capabilities developed by Ketch to align the ECC structure to the new S/4HANA structure.  Once complete, all finance and payment-relevant transactions from ECC flowed directly into S/4HANA Simple Finance automatically, allowing the client finance team to operate completely in S/4HANA while the core business operations were still being executed in the ECC system.  

### GOING FORWARD

As future acquisitions are made, the client can not only deploy new connectors based on the specific legacy system in place, mapping the organizational structure but also have all of the new financials flowing through to S/4HANA. 
The result is a flexible, scalable business platform that will continuously adapt to an ever-changing market — yielding a stronger ability to make aggressive acquisitions as well as easier integration of new offerings. Furthermore, it will allow our client to determine their timeline to move to newer applications when the business case is deemed suitable.
