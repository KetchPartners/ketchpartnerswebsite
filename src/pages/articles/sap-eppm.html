## CHALLENGES

Our Hi-tech client struggled to effectively manage end-customer IT services projects and large-scale device deployments. Efficiently coordinating the timing of people and materials at the client site and delivering the projects on time and budget was a challenge for project managers.  Additionally, they were unable to integrate numerous service offerings during the sales process to enable a seamless customer experience and provide clients with the desired, if any, visibility to project status during delivery of services.  Their main goal was to deliver a sales process that integrated all their offerings across a broad base of products and services into a single quote and customer contract. They were also seeking to improve the efficiency and user experience for their professional services team and provide a truly interactive experience for customers engaged with our client’s professional services division.

## INSIGHT
Ketch leveraged SAP EPPM (Enterprise Project and Portfolio Management), agile methods and open source object libraries to deliver a modern user experience (UX) via an iterative design process with key client business executives.   EPPM at its core fully supports a professional services business model while providing a collaborative and intuitive platform for end customers and project managers within our client’s organization.
 
## SOLUTION

Our approach incorporated agile methods to gather requirements and move from low fidelity prototypes to high fidelity web apps that were approved by business stakeholders.  Our client had complete control of the process from opportunity, customer project initiation, resource assignment based on skills and capacity, risk and issue management, project execution to portfolio management across markets and regions.    The result was a modern, workflow-driven process that was flexible and intuitive for our client and their customers.  

Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management (EPPM) delivered with SAP S/4HANA 1709 has three major business process solutions – Portfolio Management, Project Management, and Resource Management.   EPPM is an evolution of previous offerings in Portfolio Management, Commercial Project Management, and Project Systems applications.  SAP delivers highly efficient API’s (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide EPPM access to all associated transactional documents in the system (ie. quotes, sales orders, deliveries, invoices, etc.).  Ketch leveraged these API’s to optimize the business process according to the key constituents needs while delivering several custom web apps that resulted in a transformed business process.  Additionally, Ketch leveraged existing resource skills and qualification solution versus recreating the solution in S/4HANA.  

Finally, from a financial perspective; compliant revenue recognition rules are automated for each commercial project and the enhanced resource management capabilities of EPPM eliminate dependence on the employee and work center records in previous versions allowing flexible management of both employees and contract resources.
