## CHALLENGE

How can you leverage your investment, capacity, and proprietary processes in your current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to capture new market opportunities without a significant investment?

Older ERP systems are typically highly customized which stifles agility and flexibility to pursue new business models. This leaves you with inflexible technologies that hinder the business case for investing in new projects. Attempting to justify improvements to performance or wholesale replacement of your ERP often goes nowhere when it reaches pragmatic, evidence-seeking C-level executives. Companies that have complex, heavily-customized and mixed tech systems are limited in their ability to attack greenfield opportunities.

In today’s global market we find companies that are multi-national with huge capital investments in various ERP systems that cannot quickly migrate to **SAP HANA**.  We also encounter companies that are in a hyper-growth mode that average 1-2 acquisitions per year that struggle to consolidate financial results after closing and cannot absorb the disruption of a massive transformation project.  The multi-national company typically has numerous ERP systems that have had heavy investments over time with differing business processes, currencies, legal and regulatory concerns all of which make a wholesale switch to **SAP HANA** a daunting exercise.  For the hyper-growth company, integrating acquisitions can be a real challenge to accomplish and often time results in no integration leaving the burden on the finance team rushing to key journal entries into the corporate financial system during the period end close. In some cases, we find companies that are a hybrid of the two cases described above.; note that each client is unique, and our approach is to collaborate with your team to define the solution that is best for you.  

## SOLUTION

### Transform your business into an agile, scalable enterprise using SAP HANA and Central Finance

Ketch and SAP have developed a roadmap for your company to help you move beyond your current complex environment.  This roadmap allows you to continue to leverage your investment in technology and proprietary processes and move toward SAP SAP HANA. The SAP HANA ERP platform is a market leader for cutting-edge technology and best business practice “baked in” to the software.  Many know of the Simple Finance overhaul that was done for SAP HANA that integrated standard finance functions with profitability analysis.  Combining this overhaul with a new Fiori UX (user experience) has given SAP a strong position in the market. With SAP HANA, you are equipped to add newer business models with more agility and reach into new markets with increased speed.

Ketch has established a solid roadmap for migration to a fully transformed SAP HANA business model that leverages SAP HANA, BPC, SLT and a recent addition to the suite of products called Central Finance. The result of this approach yields a platform for growth, flexibility and opportunity to reach into new markets and streamline your business processes.   A few of the relevant features of Central Finance and SAP HANA are:
- Harmonized enterprise structure – Chart of Accounts, Cost Centers, Profit Centers, and Segment
- Leverage account-based Profitability Analysis, Simple Finance, and Fiori to drive transformation
- Centralized and unified reporting
- True financial documents replicated from the source system into S/4HANA®
- Streamlined integration of future acquisitions
- Drill back from Central Finance® to the source document
- Reduced time for month end close

The roadmap designed by Ketch starts with SAP HANA (Finance only) and BPC (note that this model shows a traditional BW/BPC approach, but based on your organization’s individual situation this approach can incorporate IBP (Integrated Business Planning), which is integrated with SAP HANA S4). This transitions into SLT and Central Finance and settles into a full transformed enterprise structure for growth and acquisition running SAP HANA S4 at its core.  

### Stages to transformation

Beginning with the Transformation Road Map, then building the project plan and budget with client leadership, Ketch acts as an integral part of your team every step of the way.  Whether your timeline is urgent or methodical, Ketch stands ready to drive transformation for your organization.

The first Stage brings up a fully functional S/4HANA® system along with BPC for consolidations, followed by a short BPA (Best Practice Alignment) phase to validate future state financial processes allowing period end close results from disparate systems to be consolidated for reporting purposes.  Stage 1 also includes a streamlined enterprise structure (general ledger, profit and cost centers, sales, manufacturing, and procurement) and leverages Simple Finance and the Fiori UX to transform the finance functions and lay the groundwork for future transformations.  

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/articles/CFIN-stage-2.svg" data-inline-svg />

Stage 2 starts with SLT and Central Finance that brings each company/division/ERP into a live connection with Central Finance which results in real-time profit and loss reporting as transactions happen in the disparate systems (financial documents are replicated into SAP HANA S4 Simple Finance).  During Stage 2 there will be some divisions that are still connected via BPC consolidations and some that are integrated via Central Finance.  This approach allows an acquired company to be quickly integrated into financial reporting through BPC Consolidations and then you can plan their integration via Central Finance on a timeline that fits into your specific situation.

A few key considerations for Central Finance that Ketch has learned from our recent projects
- Complex mappings of transformed organizational structure elements using SLT is challenging
- Cost object mapping and configuration
- Derivation rules allowing SAP HANA S4 COPA to be fully utilized

In parallel to Stage 2, we run another short and concentrated BPA phase to validate the future state business processes leveraging best practices (Quote to Cash, Plan to Manufacture, etc.).  This process allows us to align each divisions business model to a common template and then we update the roadmap to integrate results of the BPA and adjust the timeline for deployment of SAP HANA S4 functionality.

In the Stage 3 we full integrate S/4HANA® across all business processes and BPC to include planning functions. With enterprise structure was fully defined and implemented during Stage 1 the focus during this stage will be implementing Quote to Cash, Hire to Retire, Plan to Manufacture and other core ERP processes. As we deploy each company we utilize our Best Practice Alignment to validate alignment to the template design and then convert them into S/4HANA®. This Stage of the roadmap typically takes the longest depending on the approach we use for deploying the new solution, aligning and integrating each business unit and converting their data into the new solution.

Ketch’s BPA (Best Practice Alignment) is a component of Ketch’s Building Block Methodology which is a rapid deployment approach for business transformations.  The process starts with understanding enough about the key business processes to model the best practice approach in SAP HANA S4.  At the same time, the infrastructure team deploys an SAP system and sets up access for the project team.  Once business processes are understood Ketch will stand up a "live SAP HANA System" system with your data and then we walk your business subject matter experts through the entire system – process area, by process area and gain alignment by asking “why won’t this work for you?”  

The first Phase will be to design the future state Enterprise Structure (company codes, plants, profit centers, cost centers, Segments, and sales offices) that can leverage the Best Practices for growth.  At the same time, we implement Consolidations in BPC.  We define standard input model for each subsidiary to provide after they close the period and they simply drop the template into BPC and all the numbers are consolidated for reporting purposes.

In parallel, we stand up SAP SLT (SAP Landscape Transformation) Server which is the mapping and data transfer toolset utilized for Central Finance.  

Ketch will leverage our cutting-edge _**Building Block Methodology**_ and our SAAS toolset that provides real-time visibility to the project plan, business process scope, deliverables, financials and much more.  Our tools allow you to ask any of the following questions:

- “What is Alex working on this week?” Simply look in my team planning section.  
- “What is our burn down rate for the project?” Just click the link for PROJECT FINANCIALS.  
- “How many deliverables are not approved for this milestone?”  Click over to the Building Block Library.  

Key Decisions – Check; Risks and Issues – check…everything needed to run and manage a large-scale transformation project is available.

<div class="callout primary">
<p>For a project that includes SAP ECC, there will be some OSS-Notes and configuration in ECC required for Central Finance as well as the configuration in SAP HANA S4 and SLT.  A curious challenge for ECC running on Microsoft SQL Server is the SLT treats ECC as a “non-SAP” system which requires a different approach to implementation. As of the writing of this paper, Central Finance® is still resolving some technical challenges which require an experienced team to mitigate risk and cost.  Projects integrating non-SAP systems will allow any financial system to be easily integrated into S/4HANA® regardless of the business structure of that company. </p>
</div>


The approach shown in the paper is flexible to align with your situation, budget, timeline, and scope.  Ketch has over 25 years’ experience in integrating SAP solutions in a variety of industries.  During our initial planning sessions, we will define the approach that works for your situation and will result in a transformation roadmap.
