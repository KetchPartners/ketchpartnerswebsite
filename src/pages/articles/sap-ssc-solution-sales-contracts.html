### CHALLENGES

Our client in the hi-tech IT services industry recognized the market was changing.   They struggled with offering subscription-based services that aligned with their business model.  The client offered nine core service pillars each of which had many service offerings.  Their rapid pace of acquisitions demanded a flexible solution. Ever-expanding service options required a simple sales process.  Servicing the contracts was a challenge for a national field service team.

### INSIGHT

Ketch partnered with our client to deliver a contract that supported their business. This single contract allowed line item control of the transaction.  The line item supported a sale, lease, or rental for any regular product or service.  We merged quantity and value-based subscription offerings onto a single contract in SAP. This minimized the number of documents in the system.  The single contract simplified the periodic billing process.  We leveraged the SAP product, **SAP SSC** (Solution Sales Configurator) to deliver guided selling.  This allowed configuring the contract to deliver a transformative user experience.

### SOLUTION

We focused on three major areas to deliver an optimized business process.  The recurring revenue contract model supported all service offerings. Configurable services ensured accurate pricing and margins.  And CPQ (configurable pricing and quotation) to deliver the end user experience. We first delivered a structured, configurable service that enhanced the sales process.  All services were presented through configurable options in a web based user experience. SAP provides functionality to model configurable materials.  These materials allow multiple options to be selected during the sales process.  A classic example is the manufacturing industry.   Cars, air conditioning, or industrial pumps are a few classic use cases. Ketch leveraged this capability to deliver configurable services.  We delivered a configurable service that made quoting recurring services straightforward and consistent.  We modeled proof of concepts options to allow key decision makers to see the trade-offs. The option values created get mapped to the service that shows up on the quote i.e., the customer wanted backup service, for a Linux server, 500GB.

Next, this configurable material was leveraged by SAPâ€™s SSC (Solution Sales Configurator).  SSC delivered guided selling along with configuring the contract terms.  An additional challenge to overcome was margin analysis on the quote.  Procured services have a cost from the supplier.  Services delivered internally don't have a cost until employee time is captured. To solve for this each service was analyzed for historical average costs and a statistical cost was assigned.  This allowed a calculated margin at the quote stage.
The team used an agile approach to prototype process flows and screens.  Then they transitioned to custom developed web apps to support the process.  These apps were then connected to the CRM database. This transactional data was then synchronized with S/4HANA.

Finally, the recurring revenue contract was a challenge to deliver.  The client wanted a single contract model to support any type of service.  In some cases services were quantity based (Qty of 2 ea. Backup, Linux Server, 500 GB) and in other cases, they were value-based ($10,000 of on-site support).  SAP provides different contract documents to handle value and quantity transactions.  Ketch was able to combine all offerings onto a single contract.  This made servicing and maintenance of the customer much simpler over the lifecycle of the contract term.
