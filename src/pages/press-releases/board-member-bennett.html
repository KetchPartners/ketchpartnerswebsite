### About Robert Bennett

Bob Bennett’s broad operations background and interest in every area of FedEx gives a unique perspective in the realm of Human Resources. His commitment to the Ketch culture translates into a focus on employee loyalty and quality not only in house but also with our clients.

As Chief Learning Officer and Vice President of Human Resources, Bennett focused on how HR initiatives can have a positive effect on the company’s bottom line. When he assumed his role in 2003, Bennett has played a key role in incorporating loyalty, an integral FedEx as well as Ketch value, into employee measurement indices. Bennett played a key leadership role in 3 separate major Change Management initiatives at FedEx affecting over 85,000 employees each project, all of which were highly effective, huge successes and exceeded expectations in every instance.

Bennett has been instrumental in establishing the Ketch’s Talent Management Program to recognize and assess high talent in employees.   In all his undertakings, he has kept an operations focus which enables him to see and understand the realities of the big picture and the measurable effect that employees and programs have on the bottom line.

Since joining FedEx as an engineer in 1979, Bennett has worked in a myriad of different areas of the company. These experiences have afforded him the opportunity to develop a comprehensive overview of FedEx and its operations and services. He has managed everything from vehicle administration to business service centers and Service Systems Design and Integration.

Bennett currently serves on the Boards of not only Ketch but also The Salvation Army and Playhouse on the Square, and has previously served on the Boards of the New Memphis Institute, Memphis Academy of Health Sciences, the Wang Center Advisory Council, and the Opportunity Challenge CEOs for Cities. He is a four time recipient of the FedEx Five Star Award, the company’s most prestigious award for recognizing outstanding achievements.

A native New Yorker, Bennett received both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Industrial Engineering from Cornell University. He then went on to receive his MBA from Bernard Baruch College at the City University of New York.
