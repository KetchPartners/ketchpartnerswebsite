### The new office provides space for the company to grow


Ketch Partners, a leader in SAP HANA System Integration and Business Transformation, has moved into a new office space in Atlanta, GA. Due to growth, the company has moved operations into a prime downtown location.

The company’s former location was an older building the company shared with Midtown Consulting Group. To accommodate the growth of the company, Ketch needed its own office space.

“We are excited to have this new office space,” said Chris York, Founder and CEO of Ketch. “This space provides us with an upgraded conference room and better opportunities for employees to host meetings and collaborate. The building provides a higher end image to bring clients to.”

The company is housed in a contemporary building in a prime location on Peachtree street in downtown Atlanta, located on the 36th floor of the Colliers International building with a full cityscape view of Atlanta.  

“Our centralized location offers employees access to the downtown area and the amazing restaurant and entertainment options available” said York. “We hope employees feel more at home in our new office space and that our clients are impressed the new space.”

Atlanta provides access to an international airport, making it easy for employees and clients to fly in and out. The city serves as a central hub for all Ketch employees and clients.

### About Ketch
Ketch was formed in 2011 by Mr. York (CEO), Rusty Day (EVP), and David McMurray (EVP) to bring strong project methods, SAP Solutions Delivery, SAP HANA business transformation and SAP Mobile solutions to the marketplace. For more information, visit Ketch’s website at www.ketch.partners.
